# VideoLib

VideoLib allows you to make an account and to essentially make a video library. Your library is divided into sections, where each section will be a topic. For instance some default sections for me may be: git basics, ruby basics, ruby oo, sql, and so on. Each section holds video links with basic info and the option to embed videos. Once you watch a video you just mark it watched and you can keep track of which study videos you have seen.

## Usage
Get the LV seeds file from the LV slack.

To use this app, just clone, run `rake db:migrate` and then run `shotgun`.

Everything should be set up.
